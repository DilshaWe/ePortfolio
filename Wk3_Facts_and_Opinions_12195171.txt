1.    According to focusing on facts, on each paragraph, writer mixed
all facts with his own opinions on formal way. So, he tried to explain me
on find what the facts and opinions that writer directly taking from the
scientific criteria. If any opinion, depends on the formal approach with
proper provident, it can be the fact from all opinions that writer written.
Then I just tried to identify the formal proofs of writer’s opinions to
find origin facts on the script.

2.    The activity was very interesting one, because first time I was
not focused on my partner’s speech and the second time he was supported
to me on my speech. So, I got an amazing communication understanding, when
we speaking to one person or group with their total participation, it’s
very easy to read, present and explain.  If we do not support to our
reader, it may be a time-wasting period on our academic, personal and
professional lives.

 3.    I didn’t focus on my partner’s facial expressions and
reading attitudes when he is reading the script in-front of me, and I felt,
he was not comfortable to engage with me on this reading. But, when I am
reading, he totally focused on my facial expressions, direct eye contact
and tried to support me explain it well. So, it was very easy to read my
script to him with proper explanation.

 4.    Absolutely yes, When the second time, we involved to the reading
script together, that was easy to get a good result all over the activity.
So, I got that point, when I am listening and reading with people, I must
maintain good behaviors of reading and listening on proper facial
expressions with active body language to the reader and listener.
