Evidence is provided here of the following objectives:
Explain communication concepts and strategies
- A communication strategy is a strategy for achieving communication goals. Internal communications, marketing communications, and public relations are all examples of this. Communication goals, target audience, communication plan, and channels are the four primary components of a communication strategy.
Show confidence and skills in oral communications and presentations
- It's critical to be confident throughout a presentation in order to deliver the greatest potential performance. Confidence may enable you to talk more clearly and authoritatively. This may aid audiences in comprehending and responding to your message.
Work effectively as part of a team
- Brainstorming, collaboration, and collaborative endeavours are the norms in a team atmosphere. If everyone communicates well and pulls their weight, this type of dynamic may be useful and satisfying. Working effectively in a group setting needs subtlety, patience, and a desire to collaborate with the colleagues.
Communicate effectively in a professional context
- Professional communication encompasses all forms of speaking, listening, writing, and responding that occur in and outside of the office, whether in person or electronically.
Define and demonstrate conflict management and resolution strategies.
- Conflict management is the ability to recognise and resolve problems in a rational, fair, and efficient manner. It is the process of resolving (seen) incompatibilities or disputes resulting from differences in beliefs, aims, or needs, for example.
- Do not dismiss conflict.
- Determine the nature of the problem.
- Bring all parties involved together to talk.
- Determine a solution.
- Continue to monitor and track the situation.
